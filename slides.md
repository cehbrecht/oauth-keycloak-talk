* OAuth authorization code grant workflow
* redirection-based flow
```note

A client utilizing the authorization code grant workflow.

A web application is a confidential client running on a web server. Resource owners access the client via an HTML user interface rendered in a user-agent on the device used by the resource owner. The client credentials as well as any access token issued to the client are stored on the web server and are not exposed to or accessible by the resource owner.

The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients. As a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of interacting with the resource ownerâ€™s user-agent (typically a web browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection) from the authorization server.

* OAuth client credentials grant workflow
* From terminal or Jupyter notebook
```note
A public client utilizing the client credentials grant workflow.

The client can request an access token using only its client credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the client is requesting access to the protected resources under its control, or those of another resource owner which has been previously arranged with the authorization server (the method of which is beyond the scope of this specification).

The client credentials grant type MUST only be used by confidential clients.

Since the client authentication is used as the authorization grant, no additional authorization request is needed.
