## First Slide
```note
WPS (Web Processing Service) is a standard developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). It provides standard rules to invoke geospatial processing services as a web service. This means that it makes it both easy and flexible to share any geographical data, including climate data.

It can also describe any calculation on all of its inputs and outputs.

As an example, itâ€™s possible to use a WPS to send data like average temperature, peak temperature, or any calculated data, for every model.
